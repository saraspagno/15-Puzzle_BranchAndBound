# 15-Puzzle Optimization Using Branch & Bound

You can find all information about this project at:

This code will take as input a list of initial tiles configurations, it will then solve them using the Branch & Bound method, either with BFS or DFS. It will save for each solution the number of moves in the optimal solution found, the running time it took to find it, and the number of nodes in the tree when finding the solution.
It will then take these 3 parameters and output a graph showing the average among all of the input confgurations.

### Instructions for running this project
1. Create a ``permutations.txt`` file, which will contain the intiial configurations
